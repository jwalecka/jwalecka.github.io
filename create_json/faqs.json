[{"section_name": "Overview", "entries": [{"question": "What is MusicSketch?", "answer": "The Sketch Music App is designed to help songwriters and musicians at all levels capture music ideas on their mobile devices. We aspire to deliver a product that will make it simple for artists to create and refine their music, and then share those ideas as a lead-sheet. We are committed to supporting a collaborative experience at many levels; the first release provides the ability to easily share song files so multiple people can work together on a music idea. Our innovative Direct Interface BOard (DIBO) allows for quick and easy note entry, and our UI adapts additional notation elements. While our platform doesn\u2019t capture the entire functionality of desktop music publishing software, we think the tradeoff for speed, simplicity, and accessibility is more than worth it. We appreciate and welcome input from all of our users.  New capabilities are in the works, but we will continue to make trade-offs to ensure that the MusicSketch App remains uncluttered and easy to use, allowing musicians at all levels to focus on their creative ideas."}, {"question": "What is the focus of MusicSketch?", "answer": "We are particularly interested in helping songwriters and musicians at all levels capture and refine their music ideas on their mobile devices."}, {"question": "How do I use MusicSketch to design music?", "answer": "We designed MusicSketch to make it easy to iterate on your music ideas, measure by measure.\u00a0 By using the DIBO or Keyboard, you can alter measures in either stave, listen to your idea, and quickly make changes."}, {"question": "Is MusicSketch helpful for creating a lead sheet?", "answer": "We created MusicSketch specifically for musicians who want to capture music ideas on their iPhone, share these ideas with other musicians, and publish their songs as a high-quality lead sheet."}, {"question": "How do I collaborate with other musicians?", "answer": "Today you can collaborate with other musicians by sharing a song from your library in the MusicSketch format.
